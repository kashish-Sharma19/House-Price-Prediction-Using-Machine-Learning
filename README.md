House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A supervised machine learning project to predict house prices based on property features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, furnishing status, and more.
The project includes data preprocessing, EDA, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using multiple regression algorithms.

📘 Project Overview -
 The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how different house features influence the final price
- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate their performance using standard regression metrics
- Identify the best-performing model
This repository is beginner-friendly and demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML workflow.
